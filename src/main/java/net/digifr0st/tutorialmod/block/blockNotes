Some general notes to remember:
    - The generic type used in the registry for blocks is from net.minecraft.worl.level.block
    - Blocks need to be registered as blocks and items this is reflected in the assets as well
    - Each block will need a blockstates.json, as well as a BLOCKNAME.json in both the block
        and item directories of the models. The item version will reference the block version
        as the parent. The block version will reference the block parent and have the texture
        reference.
